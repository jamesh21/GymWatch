GymWatch

    GymWatch is a app which gives data on how crowded a specific gym is. 
    The basic use case goes this way: The user searches for a gym near him 
    selects one of the results and adds it to his list of gyms. Clicking on a
    gym will open up the details for that gym. This includes the name, a picture, 
    a map area (which when clicked opens up the map location for the gym), 
    the gyms operating hours, and finally how full the gym is.
