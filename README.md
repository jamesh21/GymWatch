GymWatch Project Phase 1 README

Features Implemented
    1) The ability to login as a user.
    2) The ability to register as a new user.
    3) The home page of the app which will be used as a my favorites list
       for gyms to be added. So far there is only fake data on this page to test
       how the layout will look.
    4) The basic layout of the settings UI has been implemented, which includes
       a time picker for selecting the time frame for users to be notified when
       the gym's fill rate meets their criteria.
    5) The Search view at the top of the home page will take the user to the
       results page, as of right now the only data displayed on this page is
       the response from the google places API.
    6) The ability to sign out of the app.
